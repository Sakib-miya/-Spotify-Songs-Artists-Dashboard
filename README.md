# 🎵 Spotify Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
I created this **Spotify Dashboard** in Power BI to help Spotify stakeholders—music analysts, playlist managers, and marketing teams—gain actionable insights from the raw “Top 50” dataset.  
The dataset alone is limited to rankings and lists, making trend analysis difficult.  
This dashboard transforms raw data into **interactive visuals, KPIs, trends, and drill-downs** for clear decision-making.

## 👤 My Role
I personally **designed, developed, and implemented** this dashboard from scratch, including:  
- Understanding business requirements and identifying gaps in the raw data.  
- Designing interactive Overview, Artist, and Songs pages.  
- Creating KPIs and metrics to provide actionable insights.  
- Implementing drill-down features to explore detailed artist and song-level data.  
- Visualizing trends over time for popularity, song counts, and album distributions.

## ❗ Problem Statement
Spotify’s raw Top 50 dataset has limitations:  
- **No clear KPI monitoring** → Cannot quickly see total songs, artists, or popularity  
- **Explicit vs Non-Explicit missing** → Hard to compare performance  
- **Song/Album distribution unclear**  
- **Trends not visible** → No monthly/yearly analysis  
- **Disconnected artist/song insights** → Hard to drill-down  
- **Decision-making gaps** → Marketing & playlist teams need actionable insights  

**This dashboard solves all of these issues**, providing a single, interactive solution.
