🎵 Spotify Song & Artist Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built using Spotify’s Top 50 dataset to help music analysts, playlist managers, and marketing teams gain actionable insights beyond simple rankings.

This dashboard transforms the data into KPIs, trends, comparisons, and drill-down views for effective decision-making.
